      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Im from the midwest, Ive lived a lot of places on the east coast but I have lived in Ohio the longest. 
        I couldnt afford college so I joined the United States Coast Guard. Ive been with my wife for 10 years and 
        married 5 of those years. No kids yet, but we are waiting until we are out of some of the debts we are in to 
        start having kids. I recently was working in maintaince and decided I didnt want to do that the rest of my life.
        Im hoping that as a developer I can make enough money to help my wife live her dream of being a stay at home mom 
        and we can start having kids in the next couple years.
